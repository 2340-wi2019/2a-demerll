    <h1>The Wizard of OZ!</h1>
    <p>
    <strong><span id="female_1_1"></span></strong> 
    live in the midst of the great
    <strong><span id="state_1_1"></span></strong>
    <strong><span id="geo_1_1"></span></strong> with Uncle 
    <strong><span id="male_1_1"></span></strong>Who was a 
    <strong><span id="occupation_1_1"></span></strong> and 
    Aunt
    <strong><span id="female_2_1"></span></strong>
     who was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carrdied by
    wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room 
    a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking
    <strong><span id="noun_1_1"></span></strong>, a 
    <strong><span id="noun_2_1"></span></strong> for the dishes,
    a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.  
    Uncle<strong><span id ="male_1_2"></span></strong> and 
    Aunt <strong><span id ="female_2_2"></span></strong> had a big bed in one corner, and 
    <strong><span id="female_1_2"></span></strong> a little bed in another corner, There was no
    garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where 
    the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose mighty enough to crush any builiding in it's path.
    It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the 
    <strong><span id="nonun_3_1"></span></strong>, from which a ladder led down into the small dark hole.
</p>
<p>
    When <strong><span id="female_1_3"></span></strong> stood in the doorwa and looked around, she could see 
    nothing but the great <strong><span id="color_1_1"></span></strong> <strong><span id="geo_1_2"></span></strong>
    on every side. Not a <strong><span id="noun_4_1"></span></strong> not a <strong><span id="noun_5_1"></span></strong>
    broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions. The sun had baked
    the plowed land into a <strong><span id="color_1_2"></span></strong> mass, with little cracks running through it.
    Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same 
    <strong><span id="color_1_3"></span></strong> color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted,
    but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it awa, and how the house was as dull and 
    <strong><span id="color_1_4"></span></strong> as everything else.
